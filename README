SYNOPSIS:
  Cell-based VLSI layout compaction algorithm based on a modified Segments tree data structure; programmed in Perl script.
  LICENSE: BSD 3-Clause ("BSD New" or "BSD Simplified") license.

USAGE:
  cellsCompaction.pl -iter <compaction iterations> -Xshrf <horizontal shrinking factor>
  -Yshrf <Vertical shrinking factor> -input <CIF input file> -comp <CIF output file>

PARAMETERS:
  -iter : Number of compaction iterations (vertical then horizontal X-Y). [default is 10]
  -Xshrf: Boundary polygons horizontal shrink factor. [default is 0, no shrinking]
  -Yshrf: Boundary polygons vertical shrink factor. [default is 0, no shrinking]  
  -input: input CIF file, contains boundary polygons.
  -comp : Generated output CIF file, compacted boundary polygons.
  -ps   : Plots the segments tree graph as a PostScript file.
  >> (-input) and (-comp) are mandatory

EXAMPLE:
  cellCompaction.pl -iter 20 -Xshrf 0.3 -Yshrf 0.3 -input cells.cif -comp compacted.cif -ps segmentsTree.ps
